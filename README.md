# Introduction
This is a collection of the reports on the NUFORC database, and a utility to update it as needed. 

NUFORC, or the National UFO Reporting Center, was founded in 1974 to collect reports of UFO sightings through their hotline, and eventually through their website. All of their reports are publically availible, but they are not avavilible in transferable formats. Furthermore, it seems that in late 2019, NUFORC removed the majority of their cataloged reports from 2005 and before. Luckily, a user on data.world named khturner collected this data before it was removed and made it availible for download. So in full, the purpose of this repository is to collect new UFO reports, merge them with the missing reports, and make the data availible for use.
